				ARTICLE 19 Brazil launched a report last week analysing the levels of transparency of the public
				agencies involved in managing the water crisis in São Paulo. The Cantareira system, São Paulo’s main
				water reservoir, is close to drying out. This is a crisis for the metropolitan area of São Paulo which,
				with 20 million inhabitants is the largest metropolis, solely responsible for 19% of Brazil’s GDP.
				Although the entire region is suffering a historical drought, a number of critics argue that the water
				crisis could have been avoided. They claim that the São Paulo state government, which is responsible for
				the water supply, has not managed the problem correctly. ARTICLE 19’s report, ‘Sistema Cantareira e a
				Crise da Água em São Paulo – a falta de transparência no acesso à informação Cantareira’ (System and the
				Water Crisis in São Paulo - the lack of transparency in access to information), analyses the
				transparency of the public agencies involved. It explores this under two headings: ‘Active transparency’
				(where the agency provides information spontaneously), analysing 11 public agencies ‘Passive
				transparency’ (where the agency provides information in response to a formal request), analysing seven
				public agencies. The report also analyses the relationship between the right to water and sanitation and
				the right to information. It cites the international treaties to which Brazil is a signatory, which
				oblige the country to implement measures to ensure the human right to water and sanitation. The report
				concludes by noting the lack of transparency in the information published about the management and
				control of the water crisis in the Cantareira System. It highlights three issues: The difficulty in
				accessing and understanding the information The lack of availability of official statements and notes
				The controversial nature of the information provided by public agencies The report states that "one can
				also conclude that there is an attempt by the São Paulo State Government to minimise the severity of the
				supply problem". It goes on to state that "the climate of uncertainty relating to the likely duration of
				water supplies for consumption (...) compromises the legitimacy and the level of performance of the
				government institutions involved in water management. "

				The government of Yahya Jammeh continues to spread fear and to exercise extreme intolerance to any form
				of dissent in Gambia. Human rights defenders, journalists, political opponents, critics of government
				policy, public officials and citizens face intimidation, harassment, death threats, arbitrary arrests,
				incarceration, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, enforced disappearances and
				extrajudicial executions. The unresolved assassination of the journalist Deyda Hydara in 2004 is an
				emblematic case amongst the violations perpetrated over the last 20 years. Deyda Hydara (1954 - 2004),
				editor-in-chief and co-owner of the independent newspaper The Point, correspondent for Agence France
				Presse (AFP) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF), was shot dead in his car by unidentified individuals
				while returning from work, on 16 December 2004. Two of his colleagues who were in the same car were
				seriously injured. The shooting occurred three days after the enactment of a controversial law to
				increase the registration fee for media outlets and prison sentences for journalists convicted of
				defamation or sedition. Deyda Hydara had taken a strong stance against the law. Since coming to power
				twenty years ago, President Yahya Jammeh has taken measures to stifle dissent and silence journalists
				and human rights defenders. He assented to a series of laws restricting the right to freedom of
				expression in 2004 and 2013, imposing longer sentences for journalists convicted of defamation, sedition
				and publishing false information. This violent repression of dissent has created a climate of fear.
				Journalists, human rights defenders and citizens practice self-censorship or flee the country. On 10
				June 2014, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice ruled against the
				Gambian government for not conducting an appropriate and independent investigation in the case of Deyda
				HYDARA and ordered the government to pay compensation of USD 50000 to his relatives. The Court of
				Justice expressed particular concern about the failure of the Gambian authorities to provide "the
				results of ballistic tests on bullets and weapons seized from suspects." This decision of the ECOWAS
				Court of Justice is an important step and represents a significant development for the family of the
				journalist and the protection of the right to freedom of expression in West Africa, but also a victory
				for the Gambian people and all the journalists seeking justice for the murder of Deyda Hydara. The Court
				of Justice previously condemned Gambia for the torture of journalist Musa Saidykhan in 2006 and the
				enforced disappearance of journalist Ebrima Manneh in 2004.

				An international delegation visiting Indonesia last week raised concerns about the current state of
				media freedom in the country, calling on the Widodo administration to take a new approach towards
				freedom of expression. Criminalisation of online speech, a climate of impunity for attacks against
				journalists, the concentration of media ownership among five moguls and the politicisation of media
				outlets are all current areas of concern. “This is a window of opportunity for the new Widodo
				administration to consolidate the position of Indonesia as a regional leader on freedom of expression.
				The time for action is now”, the mission said. “Important gains have been made in terms of media freedom
				but there are major issues that will continue to hold the country back if not given due priority”. The
				mission met with journalists and freedom of expression groups in Jakarta and Bali as well as Indonesia’s
				Minister of Communications and Technology, Rudiantara. While the Minister expressed a commitment to
				continue the public dialogue on broadcast regulatory reform, he indicated that state-sponsored filtering
				of Indonesia’s internet would continue. Journalists from across the country reported continued acts of
				intimidation, threats and killings by both state and non-state actors, such as police, religious
				hardliners, and organised violent groups, described as “thugs”, which are affiliated with political and
				business interests. This puts enormous pressure on journalists to self-censor. The successful
				prosecution in the 2009 murder of Anak Agung Prabangsa, while welcome, is unfortunately an exception to
				the ongoing culture of impunity in the country. Many cases remain unsolved, notably the 1996 murder of
				Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, known as “Udin”. “The failure to hold Udin’s murderers to account, nearly
				twenty years on, continues to cast a pall over Indonesia’s justice system”, the mission said. “We urge
				President Widodo to renew efforts to find the killers”. Authorities also deliberately obstruct
				international journalists’ access to sensitive regions through an opaque and overly bureaucratic process
				of applying for visas. In the rare instances where access is granted, journalists are accompanied by
				government and security officials. Several elements in Indonesia’s regulatory framework also fall foul
				of international human rights standards, such as the Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law
				and oversight of the broadcasting sector. Political domination of media outlets, which undermines
				editorial independence, is also a cause for concern. The mission’s observations and recommendations are
				available to download here.
